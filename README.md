# Becoming a Software Engineer
To become a software engineer, you'll typically need to acquire a strong foundation in programming languages (e.g., Python, Java), data structures and algorithms, and software design patterns. You should also have a solid understanding of computer science concepts, such as object-oriented programming and software engineering principles. 

## Fundamentals
A foundation in mathematics and physics is essential for understanding computer science concepts.
This includes:
Basic algebra and calculus to develop problem-solving skills
Mathematical modeling to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems
<!-- toc -->
- Math & Physics
    - A strong understanding of these subjects provides a solid basis for programming skills and software engineering principles.
- Data Structure & Algorithms
    - Understanding data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
    - Helps you design efficient programs that can solve real-world problems.
    - Familiarity with popular data structures and algorithms such as trees, graphs, and hash tables is also important.
- Programming Languages
    - Python:
        - A great language for beginners due to its simple syntax and extensive libraries.
        - Used in popular frameworks such as Django and Flask for web development.
    - Java:
        - A widely used language for Android app development, enterprise software, and web development.
        - Has a large community of developers and provides many resources for learning and troubleshooting.
    - C/C++:
        - These languages are often used for systems programming, embedded systems, and game development.
        - While less commonly used as a first language, they can still be useful for learning about operating system internals and low-level programming.
- UML (Unified Modeling Language):
    - A visual representation of software design patterns, including classes, objects, interfaces, and diagrams.
    - Helps you model and visualize the structure of complex systems.
- Source Control Tools (Git/Github):
    - Version control systems that allow you to track changes to your codebase over time.
    - Essential for maintaining a clean and collaborative development environment.

## Computer Systems
The foundation of modern computing, including hardware and software components.
<!-- toc -->
- Operating System
    - An operating system manages computer hardware resources and provides a platform for running applications.
    - Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS
- Platform & Framework
    - A set of tools, libraries, or technologies that enable developers to build specific types of applications.
- Networks 
    - The physical and logical infrastructure that enables data communication between devices on the internet.
- Clouding computing
    - A remote computing environment that provides virtualized resources and services over the internet.
    - Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Containers & Kubernetes
    - Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to deploy applications in a consistent manner across different environments.
    - Kubernetes is an orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
    - Benefits: improved deployment speed, reduced errors, and increased scalability

- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
    - A structured approach to software development that involves several phases:
        1. Requirements Gathering
        2. Design
        3. Implementation
        4. Testing
        5. Deployment
- Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
    - The process of analyzing and designing software systems using object-oriented principles.
- Architectures
    - A design approach for structuring software systems, which can include:
        1. Monolithic architecture
        2. Microservices architecture
- Design Patterns
    - Reusable solutions to common problems that have been observed in software development.
- System Design
    - The process of designing the overall structure and organization of a software system.
- Secure Coding
    - A set of practices for writing secure code, including:
        1. Input validation
        2. Error handling
- Concurrency
    - The ability of a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
- Performance
    - Measures that are used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of software systems.
    - Includes factors such as code complexity, data storage, and computational resources.
- Database
    - A database is a collection of organized data that can be accessed and manipulated by software applications.
- Testing & Debugging
    - The process of verifying that software systems meet the required specifications and are free from errors.
    - Includes testing for functionality, performance, security, and reliability
- DecSecOps (Development Security Operations)
    - DevSecOps refers to the practice of integrating security into the software development lifecycle from the earliest stages of development, through testing and deployment, all the way to maintenance and operation.
